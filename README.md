Project Description
Data Import and Preparation

    Importing Libraries: Essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy.optimize are used to handle data manipulation, visualization, and optimization tasks.
    Reading Data: Historical price data is read from an Excel file named Test_PE_2023.xlsx.
    Data Cleaning: Unnecessary columns like DATE are dropped from the dataset.
    Data Description: Basic statistical descriptions of the data are generated.

Data Visualization

    Boxplot: A boxplot is created to visualize the distribution of the data.
    Moving Averages: The moving averages for a specified window size (e.g., 50 days) are calculated and plotted alongside historical prices to observe trends.

Return Calculation

    Logarithmic Returns: Logarithmic returns are calculated to understand the rate of return for each asset.
    Statistical Metrics: Mean returns and the covariance matrix of the returns are computed to capture the expected return and the risk associated with the assets.

Portfolio Optimization

    Objective Function: An objective function is defined to maximize the Sharpe Ratio (the ratio of portfolio return to portfolio variance).
    Constraints: A constraint function ensures that the sum of the weights of all assets in the portfolio equals one.
    Bounds and Constraints Definition: The bounds for the weights are set between 0 and 1, and constraints are added to the optimization problem.
    Optimization Process: The scipy.optimize.minimize function is used with the Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) method to find the optimal asset weights.

Results

    Optimal Weights: The project outputs the optimal weights for each asset in the portfolio.
    Visualization of Results: Historical prices and their moving averages are plotted to visualize the performance and trends of the assets over time.
